            <h3>Why NOLA?</h3>
            <h2>New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz</h2>
            <p>
              Affectionately called NOLA (New Orleans, LA), New Orleans is
              considered the birthplace of jazz because it is a cultural
              melting-pot of different music styles, sepecially those of
              ragtime, African religious worship, blues, and Cuban music. Not to
              mention that Louis Armstrong - jazz trumpeter extraordinare -
              grew-up in New Orleans.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of the cultures living side-by-side in NOLA that helped create
              jazz also had a significant affect on the architecture of the
              city. From the colourful terraces of the French Quarter to the
              magnificant houses of the Garden District, NOLA is a
              photographer's paradise. Similarly, it's hard to define typical
              New Orleans cuisine as visitors can expect to sample dishes from
              myriad cultures including Vietnamese, Carribean, French and of
              course Creole and Cajun.
